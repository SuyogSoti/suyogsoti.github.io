Hello Everybody,

I have recently launched my own podcast. It will explore the intricacies of technology, life, politics and beyond. My very first episode has been launched and I hope that all of you will listen to it.

<!--excerpt-->

## First Episode

The very first episode will go over why I want to start this podcast in addition to going over my new interest, keybase. I was recently introduced to this new application named [keybase](https://keybase.io). It can be decribed as a public hosting of your public keys for communication using public cryptography by verifying your identifies using all of your varius social media accounts. Please listen to the podcast for more of my thoughts/information.

PSA: My main hosting for this podcast is [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@suyogsoti) because it is free. I will add the first few episodes to [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/suyog-soti) as well because soundcloud is a popular platform.
