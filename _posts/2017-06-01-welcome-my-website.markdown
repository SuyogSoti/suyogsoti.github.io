To all of you who do not yet know me, my name is Suyog Soti. I am a cs student who is specially interested in machine learning and different facets about life. This website will go over all of my opinions and interests about the world. This is also the website that I will use to vent all of my thoughts. Coincidentally, I am also the sole owner of the site so there is not much you can do about it except for just not listening to what I have to say. As much as I want to say "Your Loss", I also want an active discussion about the different discussions that I bring up. That being said, I want to rant a bit about Jekyll and its integration unto this website.

## The Real Rant

As you can probably tell, this is a github webpage which means that the website in itself is a static website. Being a college kid, having 0 money and some interest in making a website, I naturally am always searching for the cheap way out financially. I just did not want to spend what little amount of money I had on pay for servers to host a website. I also did not want to spend the rest of my days writing html for the site, but I definitely wanted my website to look unique. The compromise between all of my wants naturally led to Jekyll.

## What is Jekyll

Jekyll is a ruby gem that generates static webpages based on what it calls "layouts". It also lets me write some markdown as blog posts, and I am going to spend the next few months experimenting with the full capabilities of Jekyll while exploring topics that I am interested about. I see the blog posts that I do as a learning opportunity for myself as well as my readers. Jekyll seems like an awesome tool while the website is small, but it does not look like it wil scale up if I one day have thousands of posts. That is however still far away. All I had to do were the two commands below to set up the Jekyll project.

{% highlight shell %}
$ gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight shell %}
$ jekyll new myApp
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll then creates a directory called myApp. I am not going to go into how it works because this post is not meant to be a tutorial. I just wanted to introduce you to the technology behind this website.

I hope that you enjoy what I have to talk about. Please be nice in the comments sections. We are all here because we are interested whatever the post is talking about. Also please pardon the grammer mistakes I have/will inevitable make in the future. I am not an english major!

Thank You
